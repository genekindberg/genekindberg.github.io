## [DFM Nowcaster](https://github.com/genekindberg/DFM-Nowcaster)


A nowcasting dynamic factor model estimated using Bayesian methods, implemented in Python. Can accommodate multiple factors, a choice of lags in the observation and transition equations, and can include an MA term in the errors in the observation equation. Also provides quasi out-of-sample mean squared errors to assess nowcasting performance. Roughly based on my work in [Gauging the Globe: The Bank's Approach to Nowcasting World GDP](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/quarterly-bulletin/2018/2018-q3/gauging-the-globe-the-banks-approach-to-nowcasting-world-gdp).

## Coming soon: SVAR Toolbox
A matlab toolbox for running BVARs with Spectral, Limited Spectral, Max Share, and long-run restriction identifications
