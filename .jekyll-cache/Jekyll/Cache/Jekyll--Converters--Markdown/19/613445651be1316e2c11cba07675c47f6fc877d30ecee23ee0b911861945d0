<p>A nowcasting dynamic factor model estimated using Bayesian methods, implemented in Python. As far as I know this is the only code available to implement a Bayesian version of a nowcasting DFM (most people use the EM algorithm made available from Giannone, Reichlin and Small 2008). The model can accommodate multiple factors, a choice of lags in the observation and transition equations, and can include an MA term in the errors in the observation equation. Also provides quasi out-of-sample mean squared errors to assess nowcasting performance. Roughly based on my work in <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/quarterly-bulletin/2018/2018-q3/gauging-the-globe-the-banks-approach-to-nowcasting-world-gdp">Gauging the Globe: The Bankâ€™s Approach to Nowcasting World GDP</a>.</p>

<h2 id="svar-toolbox"><a href="https://github.com/genekindberg/SVAR_tools">SVAR Toolbox</a></h2>
<p>A matlab toolbox for running BVARs with long-run restrictions, the Max Share approach, and a standard Cholesky identification. In addition, sign restrictions, zero restrictions and forecast error variance magnitude restrictions have now been added. The latter set of identifications can be imposed in tandem (i.e. sign and zero restrictions can be imposed simultaneously). Spectral and Limited Spectral identifications will be added in due course. The toolbox also produces, IRFs, FEVD, historical decompositions, and structural shocks. It can be easily modified to add new identifications.</p>
